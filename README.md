# Project Title

Environment vision translator system 
Building AI course project

## Summary

This current project pretends to be a solution to sight disability by implementing a system that can recognize the environment and translate into words what the person with this disability needs to do next, is pretended to be like a helping dog, but that can actually talk! 


## Background

This idea pretends to solve the uncertainty that a blind person confront on a daily basis by just trying to go from point A to point B. The population of México in 2020 was estimated to have 415,800 people with partial or complete lack of vision, out of a total population of 126 million that makes up for 0.33% of the population with this problem. The motivation behind this project is to use AI for social purposes, to generate more trust towards AI for the general public. This topic has a core importance in enhancing technology in order to help us navigate through the uncertainties of this world. 


## How is it used?

Its intended use is to be through glasses or any device that can scan the environment in front of the person so that it can give insight on possible difficulties on the way.

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
